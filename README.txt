Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
üìå Project Overview

Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The model is trained on a dataset containing customer demographics, account information, and service usage details.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-Python (data processing, model training, evaluation)

-Pandas and NumPy (data manipulation)

-Matplotlib and Seaborn (data visualization)

-Scikit-learn (machine learning models, evaluation, preprocessing)

-Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) (handling class imbalance)

üîë Key Steps in the Project

-Data Preprocessing

-Handle missing values

-Encode categorical variables

-Scale numerical features

-Balance the dataset using SMOTE

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Visualize churn distribution

-Analyze relationships between features and churn

-Modeling

-Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

-Use cross-validation for reliable performance measurement

-Optimize hyperparameters for the best model

-Evaluation

-Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

The final model achieved:

Accuracy: 78%

Precision: 58%

Recall: 58%

F1-score: 58%
